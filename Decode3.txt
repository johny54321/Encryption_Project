ACCORDING TO LEGEND, ANCIENT ROME WAS FOUNDED BY THE TWO BROTHERS, AND DEMIGODS, ROMULUS AND REMUS, ON 21 APRIL 753 BCE. THE LEGEND CLAIMS THAT IN AN ARGUMENT OVER WHO WOULD RULE THE CITY (OR, IN ANOTHER VERSION, WHERE THE CITY WOULD BE LOCATED) ROMULUS KILLED REMUS AND NAMED THE CITY AFTER HIMSELF. THIS STORY OF THE FOUNDING OF ROME IS THE BEST KNOWN BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY ONE.
